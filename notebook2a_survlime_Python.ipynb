    "## Why we need explanations for survival models?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex machine learning survival models are used more and more often (also in healthcare and scientific research) because**:\n",
    "- Cox PH model cannot model complex dependencies and has the strong assumption of proportional hazards that is often not met,\n",
    "- ML models are more flexible and can model complex dependencies, but they are often treated as black boxes.\n",

    "The **overoptimistic** use of AI models in medicine **→** The need for a method of **validation** other than just performance validation.\n",
    "> There exists a notable tendency among some researchers steeped in ML to report only the model performance metrics. XAI techniques offer a means to validate and explore survival models, effectively complementing performance validation. They enable to shift of the focus towards model reliability and accountability rather than solely optimizing model performance metrics. This shift is crucial in mitigating the risk of over-optimistic assessments of complex models, thereby promoting responsible and informed model usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **complexity** and **lack of interpretability** of AI models **→** The need for a method of **examining** models that would make it possible to understand their operation.\n",
    "> Researchers rely on survival models to analyze the effectiveness of new therapies, explore genetic markers associated with diseases, or evaluate the impact of lifestyle factors on health outcomes. Given the vast implications of these models, ensuring that their predictions are not only accurate but also interpretable becomes a matter of utmost importance\n",
